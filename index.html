      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My experience interest in digital marketing and my experience in creating a new website for a nonprofit animal shelter encouraged me to learn coding. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Southern New Hampshire and have lived here almost all my life.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy cooking and spending time outside kayaking or taking advantage of the walking trails near my house.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Although I don't know if there is a particular job that I dream of having, I know that a job I would find satisfying would require creativity, problem solving, and collaboration.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Salem, NH.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>From what I have learned of web development, it appears to fit the bill of what I'm looking for in a career. I'm excited to learn a new, marketable skill that I hope will make me a much stronger candidate to employers. </p>
